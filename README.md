# Pastel Calculator

- Here is my take on a clickable calculator! My final design incorporates my love for simplicity and pastel colors.

## Technology Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Optimizations

- I started out with a single display but quickly added a secondary display showing the previous operations, as I realized it would be a much better user experience to track all the operations.
- I definitely wanted to incorporate one "fun" button to fill out the buttons, so I challenged myself to add audio to the "pop" button. Perhaps in the future, I may add some visual effects when the "pop" button is clicked.


## Lessons Learned

- I learned that flexbox and grid can be used together to create really flexible and exciting layouts.
- The logic behind evaluating the first set of numbers and storing the result for the next operation really threw me for a while. I spent a good amount of time reviewing DOM manipulation before finally understanding how to update the calculator displays visually.
- The most important lesson I learned with this project is the importance and necessity of good planning before coding. At first, I jumped in too quickly and got stuck many times trying to understand my own code. Once I took my time to plan out each step and really understand the behavior I wanted to create, the whole project flowed much smoother and also became a much happier experience.
